## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (it is small project but here is ideal to use 'article')
- CSS custom properties (lots of variables)
- Flexbox (just for some situations when 'Grid' is too much)
- CSS Grid (gap, positioning, etc.)
- Mobile-first workflow (ideally to start from mobile-first)

### What I learned

- Was very interesting to work with alternative images.
- Continue to work with variables.

### Useful resources

- [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html) - this men and his blog helped a lot to understand what code to add for accessibility.
